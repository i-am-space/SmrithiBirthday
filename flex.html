                    Right it's getting to be about that time. Who am I, one might wonder as they stare up at the ceiling at night wallowing in their pathetic inadequacy (they know they can never be me)
. How is it possible for one man to be so damn fine? Alright, you scrambling peasants, quieten down so that I may tell you.<br></p>
                <p>
                    I am literally him. I am that guy. The one who knocks. Danger, if you will. I break the bad. I jujutsu the kaisen and I attack the titan.
                    While you lot are desperately clinging to your remaining scraps of mediocre friendship doled out by our Lord and saviour (birthday gorl), i alone am elevated.
                    I am the ascended one. The elite among the elite. The friend to rule them all. But why, your tiny mortal minds scream as they struggle to find meaning in actions they cannot fathom (mine).
                    What separates me from him? Why can I not be that guy?<br>
                    The answer is simple. I am me. Know your place, peasants. Despair, knowing you may never reach this realm. Curse your own weakness, if you will. But know with absolute certainty that this result is the one true constant in this chaotic universe.
